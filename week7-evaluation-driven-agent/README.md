# Week 7 — Evaluation-Driven Agent Design

This project demonstrates a minimal agent architecture where:
- A Doer Agent performs a task
- An Evaluator Agent judges the output
- A Controller decides whether to accept or retry

This PoC focuses on evaluation as a first-class architectural component.

## Run the project

```bash
python main.py
