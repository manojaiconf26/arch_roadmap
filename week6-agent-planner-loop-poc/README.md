# Week 6 — Planner-Owned Control Loop PoC

This PoC demonstrates:
- Planner-owned decision making
- Explicit control loop
- Separation of planner, executor, and critic
- Adaptive planning instead of blind retries

No frameworks are used.
No retries are hard-coded.
All control decisions are made by the planner.
